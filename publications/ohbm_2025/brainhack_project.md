# Short description and the goals for the OHBM BrainHack

(Please provide a short description and goals for the hackathon, check [the guide](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2025/blob/main/PROJECTS_HANDBOOK.md#goals) for suggestions)

```txt
Nilearn is an open-source Python package for fast and easy analysis and visualization of MRI brain images. It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation and a friendly community. It includes applications such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), decoding, predictive modelling, functional connectivity, and brain parcellations.

Recently, we did some analysis of the package's usage (https://github.com/nilearn/poia) and found that plotting is the most used module. Therefore, we want to dedicate this year's Brainhack to improving the plotting module by resolving existing issues, welcoming new ones, and improving the documentation. To this end, we encourage users to simply filter the issues by the "Plotting" label (https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/labels/Plotting). In addition, if you are motivated to work on any other issues, we welcome that as well! We have a lot of open issues in the package, and we would love to see contributions from the community. New contributors should look for the "Good First Issue" label to get started (https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/labels/Good%20first%20issue).

```txt
We welcome all users and contributions from various skill sets and levels. This can include opening discussions around improvements to the [documentation](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html) and/or [code base](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn
), answering or commenting on questions or [issues raised on github](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4434) and [neurostars](https://neurostars.org/tag/nilearn), reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls), and [contributing code](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/development.html#how-to-contribute-to-nilearn).

# Recommended tutorials for new contributors

(Please provide a list of tutorials that might be helpful for new contributors. Make sure to include the link to the tutorials here. Several great examples of such tutorials can be found at the following places: [traintrack online selection](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2023/traintrack/), [brainhack school modules](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/), [Neurohackademy lectures](https://neurohackademy.org/course_type/lectures/), and [brainhack's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/brainhackorg/playlists))

```txt
We recommend starting with [Nilearn's basic tutorials](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/00_tutorials/index.html#) and the [introduction to Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/introduction.html). This would help new contributors get familiar with the package and its functionalities. They can even provide feedback on the tutorials and suggest improvements.
