Nilearn: Statistics and Machine Learning for Neuroimaging in Python
```

# Short description and the goals for the OHBM BrainHack
(Please provide a short description and goals for the hackathon, check [the guide](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2024/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#goals) for suggestions)

Nilearn is an open-source Python package for fast and easy analysis and visualization of MRI brain images. It provides statistical and machine-learning tools, with instructive documentation and a friendly community. It includes applications such as multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA), decoding, predictive modelling, functional connectivity, and brain parcellations.

Recent work in Nilearn has been centered on developing a new API to allow users to seamlessly work with surface data in a manner similar to volumetric data, enhancing support for the General Linear Model (GLM), enhancing the BIDS interface, and improving and updating the infrastructure and codebase.

We want to dedicate these Brainhack days towards direct interaction with our user-base and resolving any specific issues they might have. To this end, we encourage users to simply pop-in-and-say-hi. They are also welcome to present their queries via neurostars.org or open new issues/PRs on our GitHub repo. In addition, any interested contributors are also encouraged to work on pre-existing issues on our GitHub. New contributors should look for the "Good First Issue" label to get started.

# Link to the Project pitch
(not required, but highly recommended) If your project involves hybrid/online participation, create a brief project pitch (2-5 minutes) for the Brainhack audience. See [more](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2024/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#pitch-video) for additional guidance. Upload the pitch video to YouTube and share the link with us.

# Skills
(Please provide skills you expect contributors to have, so others can have better ideas if they can join. You can include non-technical skills, or simply write None, check [the guide](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2024/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/projects.md#onboarding-skills) for more suggestions.)
```txt
We welcome all users and contributions from various skill sets and levels. This can include opening discussions around improvements to the [documentation](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/index.html) and/or [code base](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn
), answering or commenting on questions or [issues raised on github](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4434) and [neurostars](https://neurostars.org/tag/nilearn), reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls), and [contributing code](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/development.html#how-to-contribute-to-nilearn).
```

# Recommended tutorials for new contributors
(Please provide a list of tutorials that might be helpful for new contributors. Make sure to include the link to the tutorials here. Several great examples of such tutorials can be found at the following places: [traintrack online selection](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2023/traintrack/), [brainhack school modules](https://school-brainhack.github.io/modules/), [Neurohackademy lectures](https://neurohackademy.org/course_type/lectures/), and [brainhack's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/brainhackorg/playlists))
```txt
We recommend starting with [Nilearn's basic tutorials](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/00_tutorials/index.html#) and the [introduction to Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/introduction.html). This would help new contributors get familiar with the package and its functionalities. They can even provide feedback on the tutorials and suggest improvements.
