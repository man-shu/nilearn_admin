# Agenda

## News

- new core dev: Michelle and Mohammad interested in joining. Added to our private google cal.

- hacktoberfest debrief: [a few PRs merged](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Ahacktoberfest-accepted) - may lead to extra work for maintainers but allows to tackle things that we would not have had the bandwidth for. No 'spam' PR but more PR that looked AI generated.
    - Try to avoid planning a release for Hacktoberfest if participating in the future

- [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@nilearnevents5116/videos): add to footer of doc and added a [youtube playlist](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrrL5W8SkvZU5IKgkrbL7SHDpiIiVybOR) to curate nilearn videos not made by us  

## OHBM

- who is going?
    - Michelle and Himanshu are possibly going this year.
- should we prepare a poster?
    - Himanshu will take point on this: poster should decribe what's in release 0.11
    - deadline 17th Dec

## Release 0.11

- milestone: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/milestone/26
- roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/nilearn/projects/4/views/3

### WIP

#### Moving API

- moving API: see [meta-issue](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4568)
  -  moving maskers and datasets is in progress
  -  moving of SurfaceImage classes to be done last
- moving example: one example would probably be better merged into the others: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4684 
    - to be put in https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/07_advanced/index.html

#### MUST DO

PRs that MUST be finished before the release

- [[ENH] make the number of vertices the first dimension of image data](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4591)

#### Nice to have ?

PRs that are started but that may be not necessary for the release

- [[ENH] Allow to run clustering on SurfaceImage](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4577)
    - could be handled in a future release
- [[DOC] Surface API explainer](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4665)
    - ready for review
- [[ENH] Handling of SurfaceData in compute_contrast](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4610)
    - ready for review

### TODOs

Some issues have not been started yet.
Wonder if some could be dropped from the scope of the next release.

- [support 2nd level GLM analysis of SurfaceImage objects](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4617)
    - need a time estimate 

- [modify experimental example Surface-based first and second level analysis to show how to project images to volume](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4642)
    - can be done after the release

- [update surface searchlight to run with the new SurfaceImage](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4654)
    - BT:  need a time estimate
    - Himanshu: to check the (IBC) surface dataset on osf and create an issue for that

- [adapt add_contours (plotly) to accept SurfaceImage objects](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4691)
    - still in scope and hopefully should be quick

- [[BUG] SurfaceMasker does not take list of Surface images](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4592)
    - to be addressed after #4591

#### Decisions

- Evaluate next week if we can get the release out by **15 November** with current point people, or if we need to further delegate

### Issues

#### simple syntax in examples ?

- avoid some 'advanced' python syntax in the examples to be more beginner friendly (especially if they do not exist in other languages from our community like R or matlab)
- some examples from the top of my avoid list, dict... comprehensions, avoid +=, -=... operators
- see [comment](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4704#discussion_r1827463392)

#### Decisions

- In general in favor of this, thought the specifics of what is considered 'beginner friendly' must be better defined.

- Disassociate tracking ruff from applying to the example section
    - Example syntax can be managed separately to be "beginner friendly" rather than "best practice"
    - Don't track ruff-preview releases; for now, only plan for stable ruff releases

### PRs

[List of PR needing review](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Review+required%22)

#### [4707 - [STY] apply US spelling](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4707)

low effort standardization.
Anyone feels strongly about this?

### Set time next meeting

December 10th, 17H Paris time.
