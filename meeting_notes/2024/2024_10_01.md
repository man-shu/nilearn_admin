# Agenda

## Reminder: Hackathon on Friday

Goal: 'dressed rehearsal' of the Surface API to see if it's ready from prime time.

Rémi: I will be "on" for most of the day, so that people can drop by at any time and I will try to prepare 'tracks' for 'things to do/review if I have 30 minutes / 1 hour / 3 hours'.

- Advertise hackathon: twitter and others...

## News:

### hacktober fest

Rémi: we could try to add Nilearn to the pool of repos that participate to the next hacktoberfest. From our side it requires adding a tag to the repo and some extra labels to the issues / PR that are involved in the hacktoberfest. I have a few issues in mind whose wording I could improve to make them more explicit on what is required.

More info here: https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#maintainers

**ACTION**: let's try it and see if we are flooded with SPAM

### 2 nilearn google calendar to track public and private events

Rémi: You should have received emails to give you "write" access to both. Let me know if you did not receive anything or if I should add another email address for you.

### Youtube channel

Rémi: Nilearn has a youtube channel linked to the nilearn.events gmail account : https://www.youtube.com/@nilearnevents5116/videos

Elizabeth added core team members with appropriate access to the account.

ACTION: create a playlist that centralizes all the talks, demo

### New issue label

Rémi: I have been trying to do a bit of issue triaging. I added a a new "help wanted" label to denote issues where we explicitly ask for help from the community but that may not be for "first timers": not 100% sure if this is very useful but decided to add and see if it at least helps us.

https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/labels/Help%20wanted

**ACTIONS**:
- remove label - not clear enough
- make a help "wanted column" in the nilearn generic project board
- make project boards public

### codetriage

Rémi: talking about triaging. Has anyone used code-triage? https://www.codetriage.com/what Came across it on the pytest repo. It seems to be a way to engage people who would like to contribute to a project but not necessarily with code. If you subscribe to a repo you get emails with issues from that to help "triage", confirm if it is a bug report, validate... Seems like a less intimidating way for people to start jumping into the whole github thing. Should we add it on the Nilearn README?

ACTION: Not pursuing right now.

## PRs

- Several PRs need at least one or 2 reviews: [List of PR needing review](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Review+required%22)
