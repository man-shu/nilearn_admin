### If we have time

Can be turned into issues for later discussions

#### version 1.0.0 release ?

Mentioned by Chris M as a side conversation.

What's holding us back from a version 1.0.0?
What would we consider required for 1.0.0?

- more like after Surface is stabilized

#### Add analytics to the docs

To help us know which parts are more looked at so we know where to focus our efforts.

[plausible](https://plausible.io/) seems to be a potential alternative to google analytics.

#### google agenda for meetings / open office hours ?

see if we can use the nilearn.events@gmail.com

### Next month

- (Himanshu) Vacation until 28th Sep
