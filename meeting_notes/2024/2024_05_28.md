## PR

- Header PRs:
  - Deprecation cycle? `nilearn.image` API change to copy headers by default
    https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4397
    - open another PR that adds a warning message
    - update in 0.13.0
  - Example to show header copying with `math_img`:
    https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4392
    - move under advanced examples
    - show a rendered HTML in the PR
    - ping people for a review

## Issues

- Adding cyclic analysis to `nilearn.connectome.ConnectivityMeasure`:
  https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4124

  - code snippet:
    https://gist.github.com/iabraham/3948d23417bf11e6933833b1e17ea7d4

  We may not have the bandwidth or the expertise to maintain this. Implement a
  way to for users to "plugin" their own connectivity estimator? Maybe more
  effort than it is worth. Advise to keep this kind of development /
  implementation in a separate fork. Could revisit the issue if more users ask
  for it.

  - Demonstrate inner workings of `nilearn.Decoder` via sklearn:
    https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4344

  - another goal is also to provide reasoning for choices made

## Priorities for the next month

- Rémi:
  - Fix CI for doc building
  - Get back to Surface API
