# Agenda

## News/TODO

- 0.11 / Surface API out :tada: !!
- 0.11.1 should be done soon (when?) because of:
  - [#4904](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4904): `SurfaceMasker cannot fit or transform list of 1D SurfaceImage`
  - [#4922](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4922): `errors when loading filepaths with forward slashes`
      - not caught by our tests... to be added
  - release could take place next week
- [Nilearn on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/nilearn.bsky.social), start posting about drop-in hours
- [Himanshu] Abstract for OHBM deadline: Tuesday, December 17, 2024
- **report for CZI**: [ACTION][Rémi] will do it

## PRs

[List of PR needing review](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Review+required%22)
- mostly good, just an old one remaining:
  - [#4287](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4287) - `[DOC] Add comparison of meaning differences of GLM between different libraries`
    - already good enough?

## Issues

### Other

- [#4885](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4885) - `[ENH] Add function to compute framewise displacement`
  - concerns preprocessing and that is out-of-scope for nilearn
  - [ACTION][Bertrand] to close issue 
- [#4760](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4760) - `use pre-commit CI to run checks and update hooks`
  - [Rémi] remove autofix in CI
- [#4739](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4739) - `Remove line-length = 79`
  - [ACTION][Rémi] to close issue
- [#4525](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4525) - `[ENH] Include "goodness of fit" image in GLM reports ?`
- [#4811](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4811) `[ENH] avoid loading whole nifti-like image data when extracting time-series within a mask`
  -  2 issues 
     -  the issue of having label maskers return non aggregated data has come before: we probably do not want to change this behavior
        -  probably we should have an example of doing this
     -  have an example on how to optimize when one has "large images" 
     -  further optimization may require to push people towards other options (use numpy)
     -  need better doc / examples

### Surface 

- [#4879](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4879) - `Make some surface 'utility functions' public`
  - move them under nilearn.surface but as private
  - naming should be closer to nilearn.image
  - and revisit later whether to have under nilearn.surface or nilearn.image
- [#4878](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4878) - `[ENH] add max and min property to PolyData and SurfaceImage`
  - [Himanshu] make it easy to access data
- more generally [Surface roadmap](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/4889)
