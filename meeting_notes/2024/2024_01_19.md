General points
--------------

- Nibabel CoordinateImage API discussion w/ Chris

    - suggestions:
        - add "header" as a metadata dict as will be required for saving to files
        - if Nilearn surface interface is meant in the long term be just a wrapper on Nibabel Surface class then we could limit ourselves to only track the data we need and let users access metadata once we wrap around Nibabel
        - filename templates:
            - .surf.gii
            - .func.gii
        - nibabel timeline: no specific ETA
            - only pointset finished so far

- Nilearn 0.11 release

    - https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/milestone/24
    - Check on 26/01 if we have enough for a stable release with surface API
    - Another option is to do a minor 0.10.3 release and follow-up with a major release in a few months when surface is ready

- Admin tasks
    - recap: https://github.com/nilearn/admin/blob/main/admin/admin_info.md
    - Planning drop in hours (Rémi for now)
        - Tweet office hours
        - Reminder email sent the day before from the nilearn gmail account with a link 'who can be there' spreadsheet.
        - Consider making better use of discord / neurostars ?
    - Coredev meeting planning (Bertrand)
        - Keep next one planned for Feb 13
    - Who needs access to twitter and mastodon?
        - transfer accounts to the nilearn gmail account
    
- New job: need for another round of ads?
    - not for now

##### Access to accounts on OSF

See this one: https://osf.io/4r3jt/

What about this nistats project that hosts some of our datasets?
https://osf.io/v7hsw/?view_only=

And this one: https://osf.io/5dr8p/?view_only=
that mirrors this one: https://osf.io/k4jp8/ while download from that address is failing.

**DECISION:**

- centralize all datasets on OSF under the nilearn OSF account
- make sure that that all devs have access to the projects
- update admin info for future on boarding

##### Add BIDS dataset with more recent fmriprep ?

- https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/4198
- must have rest and task fMRI (ideally a task wiht event related design with several runs to decode on)
- Hao-Ting's downsampled datasets?
    - ds000228 (rest/movie watching, not uploaded yet)
    - [ds000017](https://zenodo.org/records/7901637#.ZFWJ15HMI4s) (task, on zenodo) 
- other possibility update examples we have to rename files / TSV where header where ncessary to fit our needs

**DECISION:**

- Rémi to open an issue for planning this
