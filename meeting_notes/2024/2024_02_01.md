General points
--------------

- Introduction of Himanshu
    - TODO: RÃ©mi to help with on-boarding

- What actions to undertake with the wide community:
    - coding sprint, brainhack ?
    - Before/after OHBM ?
    - or another conference ?
        - brainhack in October
        - OHBM in June in Seoul, but only few people attend ; maybe a hackathon before
    - make it a docathon ? Reaching experts of Nilearn topics
    - EMD : @Remi probably worth checking with @JB to make sure he didn't have any events planned to use that CZI allocation for events ; I think that resets in June
